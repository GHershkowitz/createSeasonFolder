# createSeasonFolder

Create folders for files, based on their prefixes (S0X, SXX).

I use this script to organize my shows, organzing files by Seasons. Follows the [Plex Naming Conventions](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200220687-Naming-Series-Season-Based-TV-Shows)

Works well in conjunction with [this script](https://github.com/GHershkowitz/MediaMover) to organize media libraries, requires particular name formatting for shows, I use [TheRenamer](http://www.therenamer.com/) for that.
